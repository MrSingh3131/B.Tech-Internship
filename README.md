# B.Tech-Internship
B.Tech final semester internship with Infosys at Infosys Mysore

We were supposed to build an email server with its front end from scratch.

Mail sending and receiving protocol was established along with a secure server using hashing and salting, 256-AES Encryption.
It was Developed using Java, Spring , Hibernate framework along with front-end on angular4 with Typescript


INNOVATION - Moving one step ahead we innovated our project by collaborating a fellow project(A movie booking platform) using our api.
- The collaboration enabled the user to login to their project using the email id they have set up on our server just like we use the feature of login wih google in real-life.
- Furthermore the user received promotional offers and conformational mails via our server etc when they booked a ticket via the fellow project's movie booking platform.
